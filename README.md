## Bootstrapped with expo CLI!

Nothing to add yet - will update the readme as this progresses.

The goal is to have an app for your phone to emulate different types of IoT sensors. It should be able to connect to some mqtt server to send and receive messages. I'm creating this to support some side projects I am working on.
